            <h3 class="text-center"> A tribute to the Zoetic</h3>
            <p>
                Many a times I wonder at the immensity of the universe spiralling its way out to the infinity

                beyond, the magnificence of the cosmic force unparalleled and unprejudiced, bringing our

                treacherous voyage for avarice and prominence to a standstill. And looking back to the

                reality laid bare in front of me, I can’t help but notice the same likeness of helplessness and

                admiration I felt for that heavenly abode to this city, which captured the heart and soul of

                the many millions out there, to see a remainder of their creator’s presence and relish that

                serene air to etch within them a permanence as eternal as the soul.  Varanasi, the city of

                mystics, an epitome of spirituality, holy abode of lord Shiva, the harbinger of nirvana, the

                reminiscence of the heaven unknown, and many more are the epithets to describe this

                luxurious yet thought evoking place. As I walk into the limits I see the many faces telling a

                silent yet sublime story of a past once forgotten, the gaps being tugged at again and again

                by a force inexplicable, as I felt my own. </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">The treasure chest of authensity</h3>
            <p>
                Varanasi, the oldest city of India, does not stand just for the name alone, but it reflects a

                history so vast and rich, leaving the gapping to reinstall a sense of pride for the nation they

                live in. Varanasi, known among the natives as Banaras or Kashi, shines among the stars as

                bright as a supernova and begets a history of genesis and education. Bathed by the holy

                river, it’s a sight to behold; even 30,000 feet up the air, I could trace the Ganges clear and

                majestic leaving behind a trail of zing. Possibly coined from the names of the two rivers

                Varuna and Assi, the ancient city, from its transition to the modern scenario by the hands of

                a man named Mansa Ram to becoming a part of Uttar Pradesh after independence, reflects

                the advent of cultural revelation and has become the birthplace of many renowned figures,

                the likes of Tulsi Das, Prem chand, Kabir etc., who fought and lived for the cause and made a

                mark for the young to set forth. Sporting many a place to deem and lose oneself to the

                beauty of spiritualism and reality, I could just pick out those destinations blindfolded, which

                left a deep impression among the many who went the distance to feel the same.</p>

            <h4 >1. The mighty Kashi Vishwanath Temple</h4>
            <p>
                Foremost of all holy destinations, Kashi Vishwanath temple stands out as a living

                epitome emanating a godly aura, attracting thousands of people across the nation

                and tourists from around the globe to pay homage to Lord Shiva and bask in his glory

                for the eternity the night offers. The long climb, along with the throbbing in the

                heart, gives an element of anticipation which overlooks the exhaustion of the body.

                The hymns narrating the grandeur of the lord and the everlasting will of humanity fill

                the divine hall, calming our burdened self, in the form of Aartis sung beautifully,

                devoid of separation of any form. The Ganga Aarti, that brightens the evening, brings

                about that serene scene back to its rightful place, an unearthly experience, which

                you have to see it to believe! </p>

            <h4>2. The Ghats</h4>

            <p>
                If there is a place as relaxing and relieving, the Ghats of Varanasi would treat you to

                feel the better half of that other haven. With 87 Ghats, the city glows high enough to

                touch the heaven in our heart! People of all religion and culture gather together to

                take part in this beautiful ceremony and pray homage to the Mighty River bringing

                peace and prosperity to her kin, to rinse oneself of all sins and greed; to move

                forward with a purpose, shinning the light known as knowledge to the world around.

                The most popular among all the Ghats in Varanasi are the Dasaswamedh Ghat,

                Manikarnika Ghat, Harischandra Ghat, Kabir Ghat and Assi Ghat.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">A pillar of education</h3>

            <p>
                Residing in the holiness of the soil is yet another great treasure whose

                foundation went back to pre-independence era; a seed sown with the

                better interest of our nation and its youth power, which bore a plethora

                of fruits and is ever expanding! The Banaras Hindu University (BHU), a

                tribute to the legacy of the origin and a panorama of education, stands

                tall and tells an epic tale, a captivating one of its founder Mahamana

                Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Ji, his struggle to uplift the condition of

                India and to take it to its rightful stand among the superpowers. Sporting

                many disciplines, it’s a treasure house for all students to perceive their

                own path and become the human of tomorrow. Among the many

                institutions within this mighty university stands a tall figure sporting a

                long history of successful education, giving back a wealth of mighty

                figures, who made it to the other side. A walk inside the Indian

                Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University) makes one

                feel conscious about the general outline, the working circle holding the

                whole of it in check, the many students carrying their share of load with

                a stern yet satisfied face, the normal huff-buff going on about, general

                discussions on a sea of events and topics to relieve one off the worries

                about the extrinsic factors! Indeed the institute hums with activity each

                moment, pumping out new prospects each year for the better interest

                of the students and the faculty as whole. A history spanning the

                inception, pioneering, graduation, and finally integration of the

                disciplines to form the present day plot, the journey was indeed a

                laborious yet an amazing venture paving way for the tenacity we see

                today. Embodying 13 departments and 3 interdisciplinary schools, the

                institute provides a hub for nurturing skills and academic wealth of its

                gems. The buzz of student activities following their recess is quite

                refreshing to view; each involved in their own field of interest. The

                determined folks worked out, initiated and successfully brought to the

                surface many events at national level: SPARDHA, Kashiyatra, Technex to

                name a few, brought fame and highlighted the students to the

                professionals out there. With the ever expanding boundaries of

                disciplines and knowledge, IIT(BHU) has etched a place in Indian history

                and till date progresses with a target – to achieve the frontier of

                knowledge and share among all who wills it and aspire for a better

                My long awaited journey came to an end here, for this has become a

                place not much different from home I would say. As I stand in the soil

                and reminisce the past, I take a step forward with a smile on my face for

                the future; another landmark for a successful race has just begun.
